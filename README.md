## Project Structure

Add to ChatCtrl+L
Ctrl+K to generate a command
Now help me implement this:

Create the settings screen:
User profile management
Theme selection
Notification preferences

I'll help you create a Settings screen with user profile management, theme selection, and notification preferences. First, let's create the necessary components and screens:
First, create a Settings screen:
Apply
Create a Theme Context:
Apply to ThemeContext...
Create a Notification Context:
Apply to Notification...
Update your App.tsx to include these providers:
Apply
This implementation provides:
User profile display and management
Theme switching (dark/light mode)
Notification preferences
Persistent settings using AsyncStorage
Context-based state management
Type safety with TypeScript
You'll need to:
Implement actual notification scheduling when notifications are enabled
Create a profile edit screen
Add more theme customization options if needed
Handle the actual logout process in your authentication system
Would you like me to provide implementations for any of these additional features?
Write the file @App.tsx in full

Here's the complete App.tsx file with all the providers and navigation setup:
Apply
Key changes and features in this updated App.tsx:
Added all context providers:
AuthProvider for authentication
ThemeProvider for theme management
NotificationProvider for notification preferences
JournalProvider for journal entries
Improved StatusBar handling:
Dynamic status bar style based on theme
Background color matches theme
Enhanced navigation setup:
Clean separation between auth and main app screens
Smooth transitions between auth states
No header shown by default (can be overridden in specific screens)
Proper nesting of providers:
AuthProvider as the outermost provider
Theme and notification providers before journal provider
Ensures all features have access to required context
Animation improvements:
Added animation type for authentication state changes
Push animation when logging in
Pop animation when logging out
The providers are ordered to ensure proper dependency flow:
Auth (user state)
Theme (visual appearance)
Notifications (user preferences)
Journal (app data)
This structure provides a solid foundation for the app with all the necessary contexts and navigation setup.
In the file @SettingsScreen.tsx , The line  <Text style={styles.profileName}>{user?.name}</Text> has an error: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'User'.ts(2339)

The error occurs because we haven't defined the 'name' property in our User type. Let's update the User type in the AuthContext to include the name property:
Apply to AuthContext....
This will resolve the TypeScript error in the SettingsScreen. The User type now properly includes all the properties we're trying to access in the UI.
If you're not using the name property in your authentication system, you could alternatively modify the SettingsScreen to only show the email:
Apply
Choose the approach that best matches your authentication system's implementation.
In this project, how do I implement Test coverage (unit, integration, and E2E tests).


I'll help you set up a comprehensive testing strategy for your React Native app. We'll use Jest for unit and integration tests, and Detox for E2E testing.
First, let's set up Jest and React Native Testing Library:
Apply to README.md
Run
Create a jest configuration file:
Apply to jest.config....
Create test examples for different types of tests:
Apply
Apply
Apply
Set up E2E testing with Detox:
Apply to README.md
Run
Configure Detox in package.json:
Apply to package.json
Create E2E tests:
Apply to journalFlow....
Add test scripts to package.json:
Apply to package.json
Create a GitHub Actions workflow for CI:
Apply
Testing Strategy:
Unit Tests:
Test individual components in isolation
Test utility functions
Test context providers
Mock external dependencies
Integration Tests:
Test component interactions
Test context integration
Test navigation flows
Test API interactions
E2E Tests:
Test complete user flows
Test app functionality from user perspective
Test on real devices or simulators
Best Practices:
Add testID props to important UI elements
Write meaningful test descriptions
Group related tests
Mock external dependencies
Test error cases
Maintain high coverage
Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
Example of adding testID:
Apply
Would you like me to provide more specific test examples for any particular component or feature?
In which directory do these files go into?

Here's the directory structure for test files in your React Native project:
Apply to README.md
You can create these directories using PowerShell:
Apply to README.md
Run
Key points about the structure:
__tests__/ - Jest's default directory for test files
Test files mirror your src directory structure
Test files end with .test.tsx
E2E tests go in the e2e/ directory
Configuration files stay in the root directory
This structure makes it easy to:
Find tests related to specific components
Maintain test files alongside source code
Separate unit/integration tests from E2E tests
Run different types of tests independently
Write or Update a readme file @README.md for this project

I'll help you create a comprehensive README.md for your Journal App project:

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Run the full test suite before submitting PRs
- Include unit, integration, and E2E tests as appropriate

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Start the Metro bundler
- `npm run ios`: Run on iOS simulator
- `npm run android`: Run on Android emulator
- `npm test`: Run unit and integration tests
- `npm run test:coverage`: Run tests with coverage report
- `npm run test:e2e`: Run E2E tests
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run typescript`: Type-check TypeScript files

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
API_URL=your_api_url
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Metro bundler issues**
   - Clear Metro cache: `npm start -- --reset-cache`

2. **iOS build fails**
   - Clean build: `cd ios && xcodebuild clean`
   - Reinstall pods: `bundle exec pod install`

3. **Android build fails**
   - Clean gradle: `cd android && ./gradlew clean`
